# Public Equity Betas

This exercise provides an Excel file containing public companies listed on NASDAQ, along with their financial data retrieved via CapitalIQ pull formulas.
The file calculates each company's unlevered beta, then groups the companies into broader industry categories, and finally reports the average unlevered beta for each core industry. To update the public betas, you need the Capital IQ plugin in Excel.
